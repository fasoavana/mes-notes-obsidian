h;I want to say that chess is not just a game for kids.  
No, it is much more than that.

Everyone can play chess: children, young people, and adults.

And if I were you, I would play chess, because there are many advantages to playing it.  
For example, chess helps you stay focused and teaches you how to make decisions quickly when facing different problems.

And it is even more than that.  
Have you ever asked yourself why so many people play chess, both at home and abroad?

It’s because chess is a complete game.  
It develops strategy, focus, mentality, and analysis.

I really recommend playing chess.  
You don’t need to be smart to start playing chess.  
You just need practice and passion.
