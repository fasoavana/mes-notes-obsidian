Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  
I’m very happy that you are so numerous.  
I feel like a fish in water.

First of all, I would like to tell you something about chess.  
But before that, let me introduce myself. My name is Fahasoavana, I am twenty. I live in Bypass Alasora, near Yandy Bypass.  
Actually, I am in my third year at INSI. I am learning about databases and network administration. I like this because I am curious to know how data is stored and shared.  
My goal is to become a network administrator, so I need to work hard and improve my skills every day.

There is one thing I’m talking about: chess.  
First, chess is not just a game for me; it is like life for everyone. There are so many sensations. 
Second, chess helps me to think better. It teaches me to be patient, to plan, and to make good decisions before acting.

Third, chess helps me in real life. It makes me calmer, more focused, and more confident when I face problems

To sum it up, chess is just amazing.
